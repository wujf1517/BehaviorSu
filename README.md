### IV2023-papaer-'Accelerated Testing of Autonomous Vehicles Based on Dual Surrogates'

## experiment in Cut-in scenario
The scenario configuration is shown as below. Except for the distance (S1 = [30,100]m) between ego vehicle(Ego) and the cut-in vehicle(C1) and the longitudinal speed (V1 = [10,30]m/s) of C1, other scenario parameters are fixed

A fine-grained grid (100Ã—100) search is performed to get the ground truth of the objective function in the parameter space for benchmarking. As shown below, the critical subspaces are identified with red outlines.
