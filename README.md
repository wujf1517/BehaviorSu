## A.Validation of the Accelerated Testing Method


## B.Validation of the Behavior Surrogate


The predicted distribution of the critical subspaces in this logical scenario output by the behavior surrogate is shown as below, in which the critical subspaces are marked in yellow

A. prediction result of critical scenarios:
precision:0.9927
recall:0.9706

B. prediction result of non-critical scenarios:
precision:0.9993
recall:0.9973
